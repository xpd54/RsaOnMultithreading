   ****RSA-Encryption-Decryption****



   1) input.txt -  Contains the text that is to be encrypted
                   and will be read by the RSA code.
   2) cipher.txt-  Contains the encrypted data written by the 
                   RSA code.
   3) plain.txt-  Contains the decrypted output by the RSA code.

   4) RSA.c     -  The major code which executes and implements
                   encrytion and decryption.




   ** How to run the RSA **

   ->  gcc RSA.c -lpthread -lm
   ->  ./a.out
 
       The next thing on the terminal is the decrypted output.
   ->  in case it shows garbage text,then REcompile and RErun
       the code.
